# ThumbsUp! v8 5x12 Keyboard for Kailh Choc and Gateron Low Profile switches dirven by ProMicro and pin-compatibles

Multilevel 58 Key Unibody Contoured Ergonomic Keyboard.
3-key Thumb Cluster.

ProMicro pin-compatible MCUs: Atmega32U4, RP2040, and nice!nano (original and clones)
Supports Proglide Cirque touchpad (up to 40mm diameter).
Can be made wireless with nice!nano v2 and a battery, [ZMK firmware.](https://github.com/ak66666/zmk-config/tree/master)

The board uses either Kailh Choc or Gateron Low Profile switches in hot-swap sockets.

For Gateron Low Profile switches the PCBs must be made thinner (1.2mm) than usual for Kailh Choc/MX switches (1.6mm).
Pins of those swithes slightly shorter and sharper, so they don't have good contact with sockets in the 1.6mm PCBs.
That makes the board more flexible, which may require a case for it (which I haven't created yet.)

Black PCBs - v8 with Kailh Choc switches, PCBs are 1.6mm thick
Red PCBs - v8b with Gateron Low Profile switches, PCB thickness is 1.2mm, GLP switch pins are too short (or rather are tapered at the ends too much), what creates poor/unstable contact with the sockets in 1.6mm PCBs.
