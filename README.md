# ThumbsUp! v8 ProMicro Kailh Choc/Gateron Low Profile

Multilevel 58 Key Unibody Contoured Ergonomic Keyboard.
3-key Thumb Cluster.

ProMicro pin-compatible MCUs: Atmega32U4, RP2040, and nice!nano (oritinal and clones) with battery for the bluetooth connectivity.

The board uses either Kailh Choc or Gateron Low Profile switches in hot-swap sockets.

For Gateron Low Profile switches the PCBs must be made thinner (1.4mm) than usual for Kailh Choc/MX switches (1.6mm).
Pins of those swithes slightly shorter and sharper, so they don't have good contact with sockets in the 1.6mm PCBs.
That makes the board more flexible, which may require a case for it (which I haven't created yet.)
